1. Introduction
The URLyBird Application enables Customer Service Representatives (CSR) to search and book 
hotel books on behalf of customers. A CSR interacts with a GUI client, can enter a hotel 
name and/or location, retrieve a list of relevant records from a database file, and book 
the required room. This application can be run locally or across a network.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Application Requirements
In order to run this application, the system environment must support applications
running Java version 1.7. If the server is run on a seperate machine, a network
connection must be possible to that machine.

In order to run the jar, it requires the db file to be at a locatable path on the machine 
where the server is in networked mode, or where the client is in standalone mode.

The jar also requires a "suncertify.properties" file. Depending on the mode, this file
will either contain just the db file location (standalone) or the db file location, 
hostname and port number (networked mode). These details are taken from the user at
startup via a dialog and are then written to this file. If the file is not present, it
will be created alongside the jar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How to Run the URLyBird Application
runme.jar can accept three different flags representing three different modes of
operation. The mode flag must be either "server", indicating the server program must run, 
"alone", indicating standalone mode, or left out entirely, in which case the network client 
and gui must run.

3.1 How to Start the Server in Networked Mode
To access "server" mode, where the application will be available to multiple clients 
over a network, this command must be run: "java -jar runme.jar server".
After running this command, a small dialog will be displayed to the user. 
Here they must enter in the db file location, the hostname, the port number they wish the
server to run on and they must click the "START" button. The server is now running. 
If the user wishes to stop the server, they just need to click "STOP".

3.2 How to Start the Client GUI in Standalone Mode
To access "alone" mode, where the application will be only be available to a sinlge client 
locally, this command must be run: "java -jar runme.jar alone".
After running this command, a small dialog will be displayed to the user. 
Here they must enter in the db file location and click "OK". The GUI of the application 
will now be displayed.

3.3 How to Start the Networked Client GUI
To access the networked client mode, this command must be run: "java -jar runme.jar ".
After running this command, a small dialog will be displayed to the user.
Here they must enter in the hostname and the port number of the server they wish to
connect to. After they click "OK", the client GUI will be displayed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Using the Client GUI (Standalone and Networked)
When the client GUI is started, it is displayed with all records loaded into the
table by default. 

The Client GUI is split into 4 major sections:
		- Search Panel 	(top left)
		- Results Panel (lower half)
		- Booking Panel (top right)
		- Status bar	(along the bottom)

The Search Panel has two input fields, one for name and the other for location.
The CSR can search with no search criteria and all the records will be returned.
The CSR can also search with a name and/or location value entered and the results
will only correspond to that search criteria.

The Results Panel will then display the corresponding results in the table. 
This table shows the records using the headings name, location, size, smoking, 
rate, date and owner. The name corresponds to the name of the hotel and
the location is the city where the hotel resides. The size corresponds to 
how many people the room can cater for. The smoking heading states if it is 
permitted or not in that particular room. 
The rate is the cost to the customer to rent the room for the date in question 
and the currency is in US Dollars. The date represents the day for which the 
room is available. And finally the owner heading contains the owner 
id which is a 8 digit number corresponding to a customer. If a record contains 
an owner id, it means that the room has been booked and is no longer available.

The Booking Panel is used when the CSR has selected a record and now wishes to 
book it for a customer. A record can be selected by clicking on the record in
the table of the Results Panel. When this record is highlighted in the table, 
the customer id field of the Booking Panel becomes enabled and the CSR can 
enter a 8 digit customer id. This field can accept all characters, 
but the Book button will only become available when an 8 digit id is entered.

Now that we have a selected record and a customer id entered, we can click on 
the Book button to reserve that room for that customer. The table will be updated with
with the selected record now showing the entered customer ID in the owner field of the
selected record.   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Search & Book a Record Step by Step
Within the application, there is a help facility which guides the user through 
searching and booking a record. To access this, the user needs to click "Help"
from the menu bar at the top left of the application window and then select 
"Search & Book a Record Step by Step". A new window is 
displayed showing the client GUI with descriptions about its displayed operation.
Here the user can click through the five steps involved in searching and booking
a record by using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons or they can click on one of 
the five radio buttons directly. When finished reviewing these steps, they can
close the window in the normal fashion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  Exiting the Application.
To exit the Client GUI, just close its window. A dialog will pop up asking are you sure.
Click "OK" and the client will close. To close the Server GUI you cannot close the window, 
instead click the "STOP" button to stop the server and this will automatically close the
server GUI.
